## 🔐 Random Password Generator

*A simple, responsive app that creates secure random passwords with a single click.*

### 📍 Overview

This project was one of my first experiences combining **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a fully interactive webpage. It generates two secure, randomized passwords each time the user clicks the "Generate" button. I personalized it by choosing my own color scheme and layout.

### 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me become more confident using **JavaScript to manipulate the DOM** with `.textContent`, and to generate random values using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`. I practiced:
- Creating and assigning variables  
- Writing functions  
- Displaying dynamic output

### 💡 What I Enjoyed

I actually use this project when I need a new password! I also enjoyed choosing a fun color palette and clean layout to make the utility more visually appealing.
